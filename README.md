This is a rudimentary prototype of an auto insurnace claim processing engine that utilizes Confluent's fully-managed Apache Kafka and Apache Flink services.

Portions of the boilerplate infrastructure code for this prototype were adapted from Confluent's demo-database-modernization repo: https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-database-modernization.
